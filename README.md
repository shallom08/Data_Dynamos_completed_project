# Data_Dynamos_completed_project
A data analysis project on pizza sales using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on key health indicators using Python and popular data science libraries. We applied various machine learning algorithms, performed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation to build an accurate and interpretable prediction system.
